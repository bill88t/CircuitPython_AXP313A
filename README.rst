A CircuitPython module for managing the AXP313A pmic over I2C, along with the common voltages to power cameras with it.

Frozen Module
=============

This driver may be shipped with some CircuitPython installations.

To override the version included in your build, you can install this driver inside your board's ``/`` or ``/lib``.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.
